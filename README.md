# digiXTendTracker
arduino based tracker with GPS, microSD, and digi XTend 915MHz radio telemetry

gps_parsing contains the arduino code

read from GPS, parse and write to XTend radio every so many seconds
   also write to SD card
   
This must have been an older version of the code, there are some features missing (i don't think the SD card is being written correctly)

But the project was abandoned due to lack of interest :(

ressurected for testing the XTend 900MHz radio range
